<div class='center' style='font-weight:bold'><i>Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal</i><br>
Vol. III (1848), pp. 183-98</div>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p>
In a work lately published<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>,
I have exhibited the application of a new and peculiar form of
Mathematics to the expression of the operations of the mind in
reasoning. In the present essay I design to offer such an account of
a portion of this treatise as may furnish a correct view of the
nature of the system developed. I shall endeavour to state distinctly
those positions in which its characteristic distinctions consist, and
shall offer a more particular illustration of some features which are
less prominently displayed in the (p. 184)<a id="FNanchor_2_1" href="#Footnote_2_1" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> original work.  The part of the
system to which I shall confine my observations is that which treats
of categorical propositions, and the positions which, under this
limitation, I design to illustrate, are the following:
</p>

<p>
(1) That the business of Logic is with the relations of classes, and
with the modes in which the mind contemplates those relations.
</p>

<p>
(2) That antecedently to our recognition of the existence of
propositions, there are laws to which the conception of a class is
subject,&mdash;laws which are dependent upon the constitution of the
intellect, and which determine the character and form of the
reasoning process.
</p>

<p>
(3) That those laws are capable of mathematical expression, and that
they thus constitute the basis of an interpretable calculus.
</p>

<p>
(4) That those laws are, furthermore, such, that all equations
which are formed in subjection to them, even though expressed under
functional signs, admit of perfect solution, so that every problem in
logic can be solved by reference to a general theorem.
</p>

<p>
(5) That the forms under which propositions are actually exhibited, in
accordance with the principles of this calculus, are analogous with
those of a philosophical language.
</p>

<p>
(6) That although the symbols of the calculus do not depend for their
interpretation upon the idea of quantity, they nevertheless, in their
particular application to syllogism, conduct us to the quantitative
conditions of inference.
</p>

<p>
It is specially of the two last of these positions that I here desire
to offer illustration, they having been but partially exemplified in
the work referred to. Other points will, however, be made the
subjects of incidental discussion. It will be necessary to premise
the following notation.
</p>

<p>
The universe of conceivable objects is represented by 1 or unity.
This I assume as the primary and subject conception. All subordinate
conceptions of class are understood to be formed from it by
limitation, according to the following scheme.
</p>

<p>
Suppose that we have the conception of any group of objects consisting
of <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Y\)">s, and others, and that <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.294ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(x\)">, which we shall call an elective
symbol, represents the mental operation of selecting from that group
all the <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s which it contains, or of fixing the attention upon the <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s
to the exclusion of all which are not <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s, <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.109ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/4.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(y\)"> the mental operation
of selecting the <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Y\)">s, and so on; then, 1 or the universe being the
subject conception, we shall have
</p>

<p><br></p>

<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -3.507ex; width: 59.474ex; height: 8.145ex;" src="images/5.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\[
\begin{aligned}
x\,1 \,\,\text{or} \,x &= \text{the class X},\\
y\,1  \,\,\text{or} \,y &= \text{the class Y},\\
xy\,1 \,\,\text{or} \,xy &= \text{the class each member of which is both X and Y},
\end{aligned}
\]"></span>

<p><br></p>

<p class="nind">
and so on.
</p>

<p>
In like manner we shall have
</p>

<p><br></p>

<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -6.448ex; width: 67.232ex; height: 14.027ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\[
\begin{aligned}
1 - x &= \text{the class not-X},\\
1 - y &= \text{the class not-Y},\\
x(1 - y) &= \text{the class whose members are Xs but not-Ys},\\
(1 - x)(1 - y) &= \text{the class whose members are neither Xs nor Ys,}\\
\&c.&&
\end{aligned}
\]"></span>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Furthermore, from consideration of the nature of the mental operation
involved, it will appear that the following laws are satisfied.
</p>

<p>
Representing by <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.294ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(x\)">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.109ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/4.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(y\)">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.052ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/7.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(z\)"> any elective symbols
whatever,
</p>

<p><br></p>

<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -3.507ex; width: 26.953ex; height: 8.145ex;" src="images/8.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\[ \begin{aligned} x(y + z) &= xy + xz, & &\text{(1)}\\ xy &= yx, \,\,\&c., & &\text{(2)}\\ x^n &= x, \,\,\&c. & &\text{(3)} \end{aligned} \]"></span>

<p><br></p>

<p class="nind">
From the first of these it is seen that elective symbols are
distributive in their operation; from the second that they are
<i>commutative</i>. The third I have termed the index law; it is
peculiar to elective symbols.
</p>

<p>
The truth of these laws does not at all depend upon the nature, or the
number, or the mutual relations, of the individuals included in the
different classes. There may be but one individual in a class, or
there may be a thousand. There may be individuals common to different
classes, or the classes may be mutually exclusive. All elective
symbols are distributive, and commutative, and all elective symbols
satisfy the law expressed by (3).
</p>

<p>
These laws are in fact embodied in every spoken or written language.
The equivalence of the expressions "good wise man" and "wise good
man," is not a mere truism, but an assertion of the law of
commutation exhibited in (2). And there are similar
illustrations of the other laws.
</p>

<p>
With these laws there is connected a general axiom.  We have seen that
algebraic operations performed with elective symbols represent mental
processes. Thus the connexion of two symbols by the sign +
represents the aggregation of two classes into a single class, the
connexion of two symbols <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 2.403ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/9.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(xy\)"> as in multiplication, represents the
mental operation of selecting from a class <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Y\)"> those members
which belong also to another class <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">, and so on. By such
operations the conception of a class is modified. But beside this the
mind has the power of perceiving relations of equality among classes.
The axiom in question, then, is that <i>if a relation of equality
is perceived between two classes, that relation remains unaffected
when both subjects are equally modified by the operations above
described</i>. (A). This axiom, and not "Aristotle's dictum," is the
real foundation of all reasoning, the form and character of the
process being, however, determined by the three laws already stated.
</p>

<p>
It is not only true that every elective symbol representing a class
satisfies the index law (3), but it may be rigorously
demonstrated that any combination of elective symbols
<img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.348ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/10.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\phi\)">(<img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 3.455ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/11.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(xyz\)">..), which satisfies the law
<img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.348ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/10.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\phi\)">(<img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 3.455ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/11.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(xyz\)">..)<sup><i>n</i></sup> = <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.348ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/10.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\phi\)">(<img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 3.455ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/11.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(xyz\)">..), represents
an intelligible conception,&mdash;a group or class defined by a greater or
less number of properties and consisting of a greater or less number
of parts.
</p>

<p>
The four categorical propositions upon which the doctrine of ordinary
syllogism is founded, are
</p>

<table style="border-spacing: 0px;padding: 1px;border-width: 0px;">
<tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Ys are Xs.</td>
<td style="vertical-align: bottom;">A,</td></tr>
<tr><td style="vertical-align: top;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Ys are Xs.</td>
<td style="vertical-align: bottom;">E,</td></tr>
<tr><td style="vertical-align: top;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Ys are Xs.</td>
<td style="vertical-align: bottom;">I,</td></tr>
<tr><td style="vertical-align: top;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Ys are not Xs.</td>
<td style="vertical-align: bottom;">O.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
We shall consider these with reference to the classes among which
relation is expressed.
</p>

<p>
A. The expression All <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Y\)">s represents the class <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Y\)">
and will therefore be expressed by <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.109ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/4.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(y\)">, the copula are by the
sign =, the indefinite term, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s, is equivalent to
Some <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s.  It is a convention of language, that the word
Some is expressed in the subject, but not in the predicate of a
proposition. The term Some <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s will be expressed by <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.391ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/12.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(vx\)">,
in which <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.097ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(v\)"> is an elective symbol appropriate to a
class <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/14.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm V\)">, some members of which are <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s, but which
is in other respects arbitrary. Thus the proposition <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/15.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm A\)">
will be expressed by the equation
</p>

<p><br></p>

<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 13.933ex; height: 2.262ex;" src="images/16.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\[
\begin{aligned}
y = vx \qquad\text{(4)}
\end{aligned}
\]"></span>

<p><br></p>

<p>
E. In the proposition, No <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Y\)">s are <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s, the
negative particle appears to be attached to the subject instead of to
the predicate to which it manifestly belongs.<a id="FNanchor_3_1" href="#Footnote_3_1" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
We do not intend to say that those things which are not-<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Y\)">s
are <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s, but that things which are <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Y\)">s are
not-<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s. Now the class not-<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s is expressed by
1 - <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.294ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(x\)">; hence the proposition No <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Y\)">s are <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s, or
rather All <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Y\)">s are not-<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s, will be expressed by

\end{aligned}
\]"></span>

<p><br></p>


<p>
I. In the proposition Some <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Y\)">s are <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s, or Some
<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Y\)">s are Some <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s, we might regard the Some in the
subject and the Some in the predicate as having reference to the same
arbitrary class <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/14.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm V\)">, and so write
</p>

<p><br></p>

<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 8.243ex; height: 2.262ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\[
\begin{aligned}
vy = vx,

<p><br></p>

<p class="nind">
but it is less of an assumption to refrain from doing this. Thus we
should write
</p>

<p><br></p>

<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.632ex; width: 15.658ex; height: 2.396ex;" src="images/19.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\[
\begin{aligned}
vy = v'x \qquad\text{(6)}
\end{aligned}

<p><br></p>

<p class="nind">

</p>

<p>
O. Similarly, the proposition Some <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Y\)">s are not-<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s, will be expressed
by the equation
</p>

<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.632ex; width: 21.316ex; height: 2.396ex;" src="images/20.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\[
\begin{aligned}
vy = v'(1 - x) \qquad\text{(7)}
\end{aligned}
\]"></span>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It will be seen from the above that the forms under which the four
categorical propositions A, E, I, O are exhibited in the notation of
elective symbols are analogous with those of pure language,
<i>i.e.</i> with the forms which human speech would assume, were its
rules entirely constructed upon a scientific basis. In a vast
majority of the propositions which can be conceived by the mind, the
laws of expression have not been modified by usage, and the analogy
becomes more apparent, <i>e.g.</i> the interpretation of the equation

<div class="footnote">

<p class="nind"><a id="Footnote_3_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_1"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>There are
two ways in which the proposition, No Xs are Ys, can be understood.
1st, In the sense of All Xs are not-Y, In the sense of It is not true
that any Xs are Ys, <i>i.e.</i> the proposition "Some Xs are Ys". The
former of these are categorical proposition. The latter is
<i>an assertion respecting a proposition</i>, and its expression belongs
to a distinct part of the elective system. It appears to me that it is
the latter sense, which is really adopted by those who refer the negative,
<i>not</i>, to the copula. To refer it to the predicate is not a useless
refinement, but a necessary step, in order to make the proposition truly
<i>a relation between classes</i>. I believe it will be found that this step
is really taken in the attempts to demonstrate the Aristotelian rules of
distribution.</p>
<p>
The transposition of the negative is a very common feature of language.
Habit renders us almost insensible to it in our own language, but when in
another language the same principle is differently exhibited, as in the
Greek, <i>οὺ φημὶ</i> for <i>φημὶ οὺ</i>, it claims attention.

<h4><i>General Theorems relating to Elective Functions.</i></h4>

<p>
We have now arrived at this step,&mdash;that we are in possession of a
class of symbols <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.294ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(x\)">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.109ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/4.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(y\)">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.052ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/7.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(z\)">, &amp;c. satisfying
certain laws, and applicable to the rigorous expression of any

RULE. <i>Bring all the terms to the first side, expand
this in terms of all the elective symbols involved in it, and equate

For the demonstration of these and many other results, I must refer to
the original work. It must be noted that on p. 66<a id="FNanchor_4_1" href="#Footnote_4_1" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, <i>z</i> has been,

the coefficients of which we shall still term the moduli.  The law of
their formation will readily be seen, so that the general theorems
which have been given for the solution of elective equations of two
and three symbols, may be regarded as examples of a more general
theorem applicable to all elective equations whatever. In applying
these results it is to be observed, that if a modulus assume the form
0/0 it is to be replaced by an arbitrary elective
symbol <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.62ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/26.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(w\)">, and that if a modulus assume any numerical value except
0 or 1, the constituent of which it is a factor must be separately
equated to 0.  Although these conditions are deduced solely from the
laws to which the symbols are obedient, and without any reference to
interpretation, they nevertheless render the solution of every
equation interpretable in logic.  To such formulae also <i>every

This is a known transformation in logic, and is called conversion by
contraposition, or negative conversion. But it is far from exhausting
the solution we have obtained. Logicians have overlooked the fact,

the original proposition,&mdash;the not-Ys in the converted proposition
consist of all which are subject to the same condition, and of an
arbitrary remainder which are not subject to that condition. The

<div class="footnote">

<p class="nind"><a id="Footnote_7_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_1"><span class="label">[7]</span></a>This conclusion may be illustrated and verified by considering an example such as the following.

<p>
Let <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.294ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(x\)"> denote all steamers, or steam-vessels,<br>

</p>
<p class="nind">
Equation(<i>a</i>) would then express that <i>armed steamers consist of the armed vessels of the
Mediterranean and the steam-vessels not of the Mediterranean</i>. From this it follows&mdash;
</p>
<p>
(1) That there are no armed vessels except steamers in the Mediterranean.
</p>
<p>
(2) That all unarmed steamers are in the Mediterranean (since the steam-vessels not of the
Mediterranean are armed). Hence we infer that <i>the vessels of the Mediterranean consist of
all unarmed steamers; any number of armed steamers; and any number of unarmed vessels
without steam</i>. This, expressed symbolically, is equation (15).

These examples may suffice to illustrate the employment of the method
in particular instances. But its applicability to the demonstration
of general theorems is here, as in other cases, a more important
feature. I subjoin the results of a recent investigation of the Laws
of Syllogism. While those results are characterized by great
simplicity and bear, indeed, little trace of their mathematical
origin, it would, I conceive, have been very difficult to arrive at
them by the examination and comparison of particular cases.

<h4><i>Laws of Syllogism deduced from the Elective Calculus.</i></h4>

<p>
We shall take into account all propositions which can be made out of
the classes <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Y\)">, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.382ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Z\)">, and referred to any
of the forms embraced in the following system,
</p>

<table style="border-spacing: 0px;padding: 1px;border-width: 0px;">

<p>
It is necessary to recapitulate that quantity (universal and
particular) and quality (affirmative and negative) are understood to
belong to the <i>terms</i> of propositions which is indeed the
correct view.<a id="FNanchor_8_1" href="#Footnote_8_1" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
</p>

<p>
Thus, in the proposition All <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s are <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Y\)">s, the subject
All <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s is universal-affirmative, the predicate (some) <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Y\)">s
particular-affirmative.
</p>

<p>
In the proposition, Some <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s are <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.382ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Z\)">s, both terms are
particular-affirmative.
</p>

<p>
The proposition No <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s are <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.382ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Z\)">s would in philosophical
language be written in the form All <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s are not-<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.382ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Z\)">s.
The subject is universal-affirmative, the predicate particular-negative.
</p>

<p>
In the proposition Some <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s are not-<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.382ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Z\)">s, the subject is
particular-affirmative, the predicate particular-negative.
In the proposition All not-<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s are <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Y\)">s the subject is
universal-negative, the predicate particular-affirmative, and so on.
</p>

<p>
In a pair of premises there are four terms, viz. two subjects and two
predicates; two of these terms, viz. those involving the <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Y\)"> or
not-<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Y\)"> may be called the middle terms, the two others the extremes,
one of these involving X or not-<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">, the other <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.382ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Z\)"> or
not-<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.382ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Z\)">.
</p>

<p>
The following are then the conditions and the rules of inference.
</p>

<p>
Case 1st. The middle terms of like quality.
</p>

<p>
Condition of Inference. One middle term universal.
</p>

<p>
Rule. Equate the extremes.
</p>

<p>
Case 2nd. The middle terms of opposite qualities.
</p>

<p>
1st. Condition of Inference. One extreme universal.
</p>

<p>
Rule. Change the quantity and quality of that extreme, and equate the
result to the other extreme.
</p>

<p>
2nd. Condition of inference. Two universal middle terms.
</p>

<p>
Rule. Change the quantity and quality of either extreme, and equate
the result to the other extreme.
</p>

<p>
I add a few examples,
</p>

<table style="border-spacing: 0px;padding: 1px;border-width: 0px;">
<tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;">1st.</td>
<td style="vertical-align: bottom;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Ys are Xs</td></tr>
<tr><td style="vertical-align: top;"> &nbsp;</td>
<td style="vertical-align: bottom;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Zs are Ys.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
This belongs to Case 1. All <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Y\)">s is the universal middle
term. The extremes equated give All <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.382ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Z\)">s are <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s, the
stronger term becoming the subject.
</p>

<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.262ex; width: 44.246ex; height: 5.656ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\[
\left.
\eqalign{
\text{2nd.    All Xs are Ys}&\\
\text{No Zs are Ys}&
}
\right\}
=
\left\{
\eqalign{
&\text{All Xs are Ys.}\\
&\text{All Zs are not-Ys.}
}
\right.
\]"></span>

<p>
This belongs to Case 2, and satisfies the first condition. The middle
term is particular-affirmative in the first premise, particular-negative
in the second. Taking All <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.382ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Z\)">s as the universal extreme, we have, on
changing its quantity and quality, Some not-<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.382ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Z\)">s, and this equated to
the other extreme gives
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="center">
All Xs are (some) not-<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.382ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Z\)">s = No <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s are <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.382ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Z\)">s.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
If we take All <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s as the universal extreme we get
</p>

<p class="center">
No Zs are Xs.
</p>

<table style="border-spacing: 0px;padding: 1px;border-width: 0px;">

<tr><td style="vertical-align: top;">&nbsp;</td>
<td style="vertical-align: bottom;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Zs are not-Ys.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
This also belongs to Case 2, and satisfies the first condition. The
universal extreme All <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s becomes, some not-<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s, whence
</p>

<p class="center">
Some Zs are not-Xs.
</p>

<table style="border-spacing: 0px;padding: 1px;border-width: 0px;">

<td style="vertical-align: bottom;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Ys are Xs.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="vertical-align: top;"> &nbsp;</td>
<td style="vertical-align: bottom;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All not-Ys are Zs.</td></tr>

<p>
This belongs to Case 2, and satisfies the second condition. The
extreme Some <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s becomes All not-<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s,
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class='center'> ∴ All not-<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s are <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.382ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Z\)">s.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The other extreme treated in the same way would give
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="center">
All not-<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.382ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Z\)">s are <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">s,
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="nind">
which is an equivalent result.
</p>

<p>
If we confine ourselves to the Aristotelian premises A, E, I, O, the
second condition of inference in Case 2 is not needed. The conclusion
will not necessarily be confined to the Aristotelian system.

&\text{Some Ys are not-Xs.}\\
&\text{All Zs are not-Ys.}
}
\right.

<p class="nind">
This belongs to Case 2, and satisfies the first condition. The result

<p>
These appear to me to be the ultimate laws of syllogistic inference.
They apply to every case, and they completely abolish the distinction
of figure, the necessity of conversion, the arbitrary and partial<a id="FNanchor_9_1" href="#Footnote_9_1" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
rules of distribution, &amp;c. If all logic were reducible to the
syllogism these might claim to be regarded as the rules of logic. But
logic, considered as the science of the relations of classes has been
shewn to be of far greater extent. Syllogistic inference, in the
elective system, corresponds to elimination. But this is not the
highest in the order of its processes. All questions of elimination
may in that system be regarded as subsidiary to the more general
problem of the solution of elective equations. To this problem all
questions of logic and of reasoning, without exception, may be
referred. For the fuller illustrations of this principle I must
however refer to the original work. The theory of hypothetical
propositions, the analysis of the positive and negative elements, into
which all propositions are ultimately resolvable, and other similar
topics are also there discussed.
</p>

<p>
Undoubtedly the final aim of speculative logic is to assign the
conditions which render reasoning possible, and the laws which
determine its character and expression. The general axiom (A) and the
laws (1), (2), (3), appear to convey the most definite solution that
can at present be given to this question. When we pass to the
consideration of hypothetical propositions, the same laws and the
same general axiom which ought perhaps also to be regarded as a law,
continue to prevail; the only difference being that the subjects of
thought are no longer classes of objects, but cases of the coexistent
truth or falsehood of propositions. Those relations which logicians
designate by the terms conditional, disjunctive, &amp;c., are referred
by Kant to distinct conditions of thought. But it is a very remarkable
fact, that the expressions of such relations can be deduced the one
from the other by mere analytical process. From the equation
<img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.109ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/4.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(y\)"> = <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.391ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/12.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(vx\)">, which expresses the <i>conditional</i>
proposition, "If the proposition <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Y\)"> is true the proposition <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">
is true," we can deduce
</p>

<p><br></p>

<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 34.488ex; height: 2.262ex;" src="images/60.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\[
\begin{aligned}
yx + (1 - y)x + (1 - y)(1 - x) = 1,
\end{aligned}
\]"></span>

<p><br></p>


<p class="nind">
which expresses the <i>disjunctive</i> proposition, "Either
<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Y\)"> and <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)"> are together true, or <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)">
is true and <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Y\)"> is false, or they are both false," and
again the equation <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.109ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/4.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(y\)">(1 - <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.294ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(x\)">) = 0,
which expresses a relation of coexistence, <i>viz.</i> that the
truth of <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm Y\)"> and the falsehood of <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm X\)"> do not coexist.
The distinction in the mental regard, which has the best title to be
regarded as fundamental, is, I conceive, that of the affirmative and
the negative. From this we deduce the direct and the inverse in operations,
the true and the false in propositions, and the opposition of qualities
in their terms.
</p>

<p>
The view which these enquiries present of the nature of language is a
very interesting one. They exhibit it not as a mere collection of
signs, but as a system of expression, the elements of which are
subject to the laws of the thought which they represent. That those
laws are as rigorously mathematical as are the laws which govern the
purely quantitative conceptions of space and time, of number and
magnitude, is a conclusion which I do not hesitate to submit to the
exactest scrutiny.
